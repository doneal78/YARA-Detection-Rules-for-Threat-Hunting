# Platform Adjustments

## Windows
- Keep PowerShell strings like `Invoke-Expression`, `FromBase64String`.
- Keep registry and `.dll` references.

## Linux / macOS
- Focus on `/bin/sh`, `bash -c`, `/etc/rc.local`, `crontab`.
- macOS-specific: `Library/LaunchAgents`, `launchctl`, `.plist` persistence.

## Customizing
- To remove macOS from cross‑platform rules: delete lines referencing `Library/LaunchAgents` or adjust string sets.
- For Linux‑only scanning: drop Windows strings and focus on shell tools and cron entries.
