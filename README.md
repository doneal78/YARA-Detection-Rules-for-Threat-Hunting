# YARA-Detection-Rules-for-Threat-Hunting
This repository contains **five** cross‑platform YARA rules crafted for detection engineering. Each rule includes metadata and is modular, adjustable, and ready for real‑world deployment.

## Rules Overview

| Rule Name                  | Description                               | Platforms         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Suspicious Shell Exec     | Flags suspicious shell execution          | Cross‑platform    |
| PowerShell Obfuscation    | Detects encoded or obfuscated PowerShell  | Windows           |
| Credential Dumping Tools  | Signatures for credential dumping tools   | Cross‑platform    |
| Common Malware Strings    | Generic malware string indicators         | Cross‑platform    |
| Persistence Mechanisms    | Detection of persistence artifacts        | Cross‑platform    |

## Adjustability

- Remove or add strings per platform for fine‑tuning.
- Modify threshold logic (e.g. `2 of` to `1 of`) to reduce or increase sensitivity.
- Extend with new indicators from threat intel feeds or malware samples.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Use `yarac`/`yara` to test each rule locally or in your CI pipelines.
3. Run `yara -r rules/` against sample data for validation.
4. Submit improvements or new rules via pull requests.

## Contributing & Guidelines

- See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for style guidelines and review process.
- Use `docs/platforms.md` to understand how to adapt rules to Windows, Linux, or macOS targets.

## Disclaimer

These rules are provided for educational and detection engineering use. Test thoroughly in safe environments before production deployment.
